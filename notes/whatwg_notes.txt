#__WIKI:

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards
organisation for world wide web (?). 

W3C was founded in 1994
W3C is led by Tim Berners-Lee

W3C is made up of member organisation that maintain full-time staff

W3C function is the development of standards for the WWW. 
W3C also engages in education, outreach, develops software and is like an
open forum for discussion about the "Web"

...
founded at MIT in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left CERN. W3C attempt to
get all vendors to implement core principles and elements chosen by the
consortium. W3C standards have 4 levels of development with 4th being W3C
recommendation (REC)
consortium is governed by its membership. The list of members is available to
the public. It includes businesses, non profit, universities, governmental,
and individuals.

from introduction:

__is this html5? 
~yes. html5 is a buzzword meant to encompass modern web technologies 

__background:
html is www core markup language. Original intended use was semantically
describing scientific documents. Its general design enabled it to be adapted
to describe other types of documents and applications

__audience:
this document is not suited for readers that don't have at least a minimal
knowledge of web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for
precision and brevity for completeness. Familiarity with basics of DOM is
necessary for a complete understanding of a more technical aspects of the
documentation. And understanding of JS, CSS, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character
encodings, Web IDL will also be helpful.

#___DOM (from mozilla):
DOM stands for Document Object Model. JavaScript is typically used to access
DOM. All properties, methods and events available for manipulating and
creating webpages are organized into objects. The DOM is built using multiple
APIs that work together. Core DOM defines the entities describing any document
and objects within it. i.e. it represents a document tree and each branch of a
tree ends in a node. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With
them it is possible to change document structure, style or context. 
DOM is connecting web pages to scripts or programming languages (JavaScript)
by representing structure of the document in memory.

DOM is not a programming
language in itself. DOM is a WEB (WWW) API (Application Programming Interface)

beyond core DOM, there is HTML DOM representing every HTML element, and
others: SVG, XML.

#___WWW (wiki, intro)
World Wide Web (WWW) commonly know as Web is an information system enabling
documents and other web resources to be accessed over internet. 

Documents and downloadable media is made available through web servers, and
can be accessed by programs such as browsers. This servers and resources are
identified by URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Original and still very common
resource type is a web page formatted in HTML. 

The information in the Web is transferred over the internet using HTTP
(HyperText Transfer Protocol)

Multiple web resources with a common theme and a common domain name make up a
website. One server can host many unpopular websites, while popular websites
are hosted using several servers. 

WWW is word dominant software platform. It is primary tool people use to
interact with internet. 

__The Web was invented in CERN by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and opened to
general public in 1991. It was conceived as universal linked information
system.

#___Internet (wiki, intro)
a global system of interconnected computer networks using TCP/IP (internet protocol suite) to communicate between network and devices. It is a network of networks (internetworking) such that any pair of hosts in the connected networks can
exchange messages without being limited by the differences of their hardware-level networking technologies. 

#!_Internet is using internet protocol suite = TCP/IP. 
#!_There are 2 principal name spaces 'on the internet' IP = Internet Protocol
address and DNS = Domain Name System, directed by Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers = ICANN. 

i.e. computers AB1 and AB2 are connected to a wi-fi(tm) network though a
router (?), and router is connected to a broadband/cable modem
(modulator/demodulator) connected by DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) with ISP (internet service provider) infrastructure. 
ISP are divided into 3 tiers 
 Tier 1 - 
  transit free network that peers with every other Tier 1 network
 Tier 2 -
  has some peers but still purchases IP transit to reach some parts of the
  internet
 Tier 3 -
  network purchases IP transit with no peers
Both AB1 and AB2 can connect to any other computer routed to any ISP.

Internet enables such services as telephony, file sharing, electronic mail,
interlinked hypertext documents of WWW. 

IETF = Internet Engineering Task Force is working on developing technologies
that enable the Internet.
